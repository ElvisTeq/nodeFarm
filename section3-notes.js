// Dynamic websites VS API-Powered Websites

// static website => website never changes automatically

// Dynamic => Website can change every time we visit
// => Only the browser can consume it

// API => Similar to Dynamic, but the building phase is cofused on front-end
// => can be used/request by anybody
